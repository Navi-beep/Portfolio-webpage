                <h1>About me</h1>
                <strong><small> 
                My dream job is to be a Front End Web Developer. After graduating high school in 2007, I moved to England where I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Forensic Science in 2015. After working at an engine oil additive company until 2019, I moved back home to Illinois.</small></strong>

                <p>My first experience with web development was in 2003, when I learned how to use HTML and CSS in order to customize my Neopets shop. After that, I learned how to edit my MySpace page. I really loved coding at the time, but ended up going into the Forensic Science field and earning my degree in it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                After working for 4 years in a laboratory, I realized it isn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. After moving back to Illinois, I took on a couple different positions trying to find myself, and during my free time, rediscovered my love for coding. During lockdown, I spent my free time learning C#, HTML, and CSS. I became determined to learn even more and wanted pursue a career in coding, so I took the opportunity to enroll in Coding Temple.</p>

                <h1>My hobbies</h1>
                <strong><small>In my free time, I like to watch YouTube and Netflix. I also spend my time taking care of plants, drinking an absurd amount of coffee,  gardening, and playing video games. </small></strong>

                <p>My favorite YouTube Channel to watch is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RedLetterMedia">Red Letter Media</a> It's basically just a bunch of guys who review tv shows and movies that they've seen. They have a couple different series that they do including: 'Best of the Worst', 'Half In the Bag', and 're:View'. <br>

                <br>
                I recently got into gardening, and love taking care of plants. I find it very therapeutic. The other day I planted some basil, so once it grows I plan on making a nice caprese salad with it. But, alas! I am impatient, so it's hard for me to be waiting a long time for it.

                </figure> Gardening is a really great hobby, I find it super relaxing, and not only do I help the plants, it helps me! It's also fun to watch the birds that visit. There's always alot of cardinals and hummingbirds that come by to check things out.

                My other hobby is coffee! I know it's not exactly a hobby, but coffee is the way I manage to get anything done. I love finding new  interesting places to get coffee. One of my favorite places is called 'Bubo Coffee', it's a tiny little drive through place in West Chicago, Illinois. They make the best coffee there! My favorite is the iced mocha with cinnamon. yum yum.

                <h1>My cockatiel</h1>
                <strong><small>I have a cockatiel who is almost 3 years old, she means the world to me!</small></strong>
                <p>My cockatiel's name is Peanut. Her original name was Princess Buttercup, but over time it got shortened and changed to Peanut. Her name originated from my favorite movie, 'The Princess Bride'.

                Her favorite activities include eating millet, chewing on objects she can find, and chirping at other birds out the window. She also enjoys begging for scratches. </p>

                <h1>My favorite video games</h1>
                <strong><small>I have been playing video games since I was about six years old. My favorites include Tomb Raider, Animal Crossing, and Oblivion. </small></strong>
                <p>My most favorite game of all time is Tomb Raider. I grew up playing games  that my dad would buy. After my dad picked up Tomb Raider at Target in the 90s, I soon became a fan!
                <figure> <img class="img" src="images/tombraider.jpeg"> <figcaption><em>Tomb Raider, 1996 </em></figcaption></figure>
                I loved the game so much I played almost every single one in the series. In 2016, there was a Anniversary event that occured at the Quad in Derby, England. I was living in Derby, England at that time and got to attend. It was awesome! I got to speak to the creators of the series and got to ask a couple of questions. Also, I didn't know after after I had moved to Derby, that Core Design, the company who made it, had been located down the road from where I lived! I also have a nice collection of Tomb Raider stuff, and I even got a tattoo of Lara Croft!</p>
