                <h1>About me</h1>
                <strong><small> 
                In March 2019, I visited Edinburgh, Scotland. It was amazing! But rainy, and cold.</small></strong>
                <p>I took the train from Derby, England all the way to Edinburgh, Scotland. It took over 4 hours, but was worth the trip! The scenery was really nice, but I couldn't wait to get off of the train and walk around.

                All of the buildings are really beautiful, but Scotland has a dark history! <figure>

                It was rainy out, but one of the first things I wanted to do was check out Greyfriar's Kirkyard, supposably one of the most haunted cemeteries in the world!<figure>

                I also went to see the Edinburgh Vaults, however it was took dark to take any photos as it was underground.

                The next day I went to visit Edinburgh Castle, it was a long walk uphill.

                </figure>
                I walked around for awhile outside the grounds and checked out the gift shop before heading inside the castle. Also bought a cute coffee cup!
